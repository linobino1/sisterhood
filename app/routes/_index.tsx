          "The Sisterhood of Traveling Feminist Literature” is a project focused
          on sharing the literature we have come to love and appreciate as women
          by passing on books from one hand to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project takes the form of an <i>Ex Libris</i>, that you are meant
          to sign your name on. traditionally, an ex libris is a personal stamp
          pasted on the front endpaper of a book. it indicating the ownership
          and literally means "from the library of...". by both adhering to and
          countering this tradition, sisterhood's ex libris, along with the
          continuous markings of different women through whose hands the book
          has passed, is meant to create a connection—a sisterhood, if you will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temporary ownership that comes with the signature allows you to do
          whatever you want with the book: draw, write, scribble in the margins,
          question, love or hate it. books are meant to be interacted with - to
          live their own lives and to archive the lives of the people who have
          owned them, even if only temporarily. after reading, don't keep the
          book: Share it with someone you think will enjoy it the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the book you got is not to your taste, don't force yourself to read
          it - just pass it on. if you don't feel comfortable signing it as
          yours, be a silent part of the sisterhood. the only goal is that the
          book never returns to its original owner..
